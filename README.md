e-Yantra Competitions teach state-of-the-art practical skills using Project-Based Learning (ONLINE) through our unique MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses). This year’s eYRC themes sensitise participants to problems of using technology in FUTURE CITIES. We have 6 themes, each of which teaches futuristic skills to eventually be used to solve real problems.

Theme description

Tackling challenges in mobility is of the utmost importance for a city to become “Smart”. Many industries began using home delivery through the years as a way to enhance their services. 
However, this technique necessitates the use of labour as well as a vehicle, which increases fuel consumption. What if we sent robots to your door to bring medicines?
In the "Pharma Bot" theme, we attempt to address this issue by building autonomous delivery robots that "pick up" medicine packets from pharmacies and distribute them across our "Smart city"
arena.
